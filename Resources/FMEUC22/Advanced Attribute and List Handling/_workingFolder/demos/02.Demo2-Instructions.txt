Diving Deeper/Abyssal Plain Demo (approx 17 min demo)
Start with an empty workspace. Source data available use the CoV data site:
      ftp://webftp.vancouver.ca/opendata/csv/2016Parking_Tickets.csv


Add a CSV Reader again using Quick Add. Mention this is now a Feature Table - new technology
Add Parking Ticket Data [note if it is slow that it’s a 23mb file, 424,000 records]

Explain the dataset. Note the date of offence DATE is month/day/year

Add a Sampler to fetch just 100 random records (as an example dataset). Make sure it is RANDOM!

DATETIME. This is new and very cool. Put a DateFormatter - dates must be in FME format
Put a DateTimeCalculator - calculate six months on and save as PaymentDate

Put an AttributeManager: @DateTimeDiff(@Timestamp(^Y^m^d),@Value(PaymentDate),Months)

ie What is the difference between the payment date and today? If it is positive then payment is overdue.

In AttrManager, create OVERDUE as a Conditional Attribute (if PAYMENT=N AND OverdueDate>0, then OVERDUE=Y) [be sure to set it as an AND]

Add Inspector. Group by OVERDUE and PAYMENT. Shows:
- Who has paid
- Who hasn’t paid, but has time
- Who hasn’t paid and is overdue

Show how each table view in the DI has to be selected now, but when it is, it becomes added as a tab. Explain this is for performance reasons.

DATETIME: Note complexity of issue. For example: Feb 28th + 6 months is August 28th. It’s not “the last day of the month” - although we may have that in 2017.1. And Aug 30th + 6 months? Is February 28th. Similarly, Feb 29th 2016 + 1 year? Feb 28th 2017

We now have end-to-end fractional support down to nanosecond resolution. Reader-Transformers-Writer.

Also supports UTC offsets and times, which is great for Server because TimeStamp could produce different results depending on what region your AWS is in.

No leap second support… yet. 2018 is likely.

Publish the workspace to FME Server to show Server connections
Mention, btw, that database connections now also work for all file database formats (eg geodatabase)
