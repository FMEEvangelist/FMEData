He told me that as far as he knows the manufacture requested the panels to face SW and that the sign shop was instructed to install them that way, he also asked me to ask the manufacture if this was still the way they wanted them installed the next time I spoke with them and to inform him of any changes so he could relay the message. I left the sign as is and I will try and locate another battery for the DSDD unit, I will also contact the manufacture and get more clarification about how we should face solar panels and if running a unit off a single battery is recommended for future reference.
