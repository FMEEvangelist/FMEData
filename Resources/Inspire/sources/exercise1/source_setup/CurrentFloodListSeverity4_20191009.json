The forecast tides at Great Yarmouth will restrict the freshwater river drainage out to sea resulting in higher than normal water levels within the Broads until the current high tides pass. We expect to see high water levels in Brundall and Reedham riverside areas.  The combination of heavy rainfall over the weekend and rising spring tides means that this flood alert is likely to remain in place for several days, although we do not expect the situation to escalate. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and will next update this message tomorrow morning, Wednesday 9th October 2019." ,
